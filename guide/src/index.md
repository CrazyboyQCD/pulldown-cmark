# Guide

Pulldown-cmark is a Markdown parser based on [pull parsing](https://www.xmlpull.org/history/index.html),
a high-performance, low-memory approach to parsing resursive-ish grammars like commonmark or xml.

This book is not (currently) a detailed guide to using the API,
but it does publish detailed, example-based descriptions of the supported syntax.
